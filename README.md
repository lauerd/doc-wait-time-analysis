# Introduction
This repository contains the Python code that was written to complete a data analytics project, where the project's goal was to determine how effective AI interventions are at shortening wait times for radiology patients that are flagged (by AI) to be positive for a given medical condition. More information about the project can be found within the "main.py" file.

# Usage Instructions

At the request of the project's manager, the dataset that the Python code analyzes has been removed from public view. Therefore, the code cannot be run by a user. However, a user may view the plots that were created by the code in the "plots" folder. A user may also view the code itself by first downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and opening the code files (the files with the ".py" extension) within Visual Studio Code. Note that there are three code files:

* "main.py" - contains the project's primary workflow.
* "functions.py" - contains functions that support the project's primary workflow in "main.py".
* "class_to_read_config.py" - contains a class that reads and applied the configuration file "config.ini", where the configuration file contains the parameters that are used throughout the project.
